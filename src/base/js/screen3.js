We have not only the largest map of Pripyat, but also the most accurate and cool, because who, if not us, will deal with this better? You walk around the zone and see the usual views, but you always find something new, because we have our own mechanics and our own plot. And this is much more interesting than working on that one, stalker!</p>

                            <p className='text__a_small'>Listen, stalker, and on our server there is a second advantage - complete freedom. Here they won't tell you what to do, what not to do, just don't violate ethical principles, otherwise you'll be asking questions like black-nosed. You can do whatever your heart desires, just don't use mutants to beat the system, they can't fly high in smoke. You can become anyone, even a scientist or a merchant. Everything is in your hands, stalker, just make sure that the regulator does not overheat.</p>

Yes, yes, we don't have to pay a bunch of caps, we use the "left" version of Minecraft, so you can enter the server for free. So it's better than wasting temporary cartridges on tedious work, right, stalker?</p>
